# top-down-roblox-movement
A controller for a top down movement system that was sort of inspired by Hotline Miami.

## Setup:
just download and open the RBXL file in the releases, then feel free to copy over the MainModule from replicated storage to your game.

anyhow, I thank thee for using my system.
